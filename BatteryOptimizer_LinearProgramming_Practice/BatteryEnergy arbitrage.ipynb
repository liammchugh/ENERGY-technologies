    "# Problem and approach\n",
    "\n",
    "The task is to formulate an operation strategy for a grid connected battery system, to perform energy arbitrage on the New York Independent System Operator (NYISO) day-ahead market. What is the NYISO? According to their [website](https://www.nyiso.com/what-we-do),\n",
    ">The NYISO is the New York Independent System Operator — the organization responsible for managing New York’s electric grid and its competitive wholesale electric marketplace.\n",
    "\n",
    "The NYISO makes the next day's hourly energy prices available at 11am each day (NYISO 2019, references available at bottom of page). The battery system we design here will schedule the next 24 hours of battery operation (noon of the current day through the 11am hour of the next day) using this information. We will assume that after the daily price announcement from the NYISO, the next 36 hours of price information are available: the prices for the remaining 12 hours of the current day, as well as 24 hours worth of prices for the next day. Therefore the optimization time horizon will be 36 hours, to take advantage of all available future price information.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the operational schedule will be repeated each day, the last 12 hours of the 36 hour strategy will always be ignored. This is because new price information will become available at 11am the following day, which we can take advantage of. However these \"extra 12 hours\" of data are not wasted; I determined in initial experiments that having a 36 hour time horizon creates a more profitable arbitrage strategy than shorter horizons. This makes intuitive sense, because the more future information we can incorporate into the arbitrage strategy, the more profitable it should be. You can experiment with different horizons using the code below, although the horizon is assumed to be at least 24 hours here. The plan can be visualized as follows:\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "The battery is said to be a price taker, meaning its activities do not affect the price of energy. The price paid for power to charge the battery, and revenue from discharging, is the location based marginal price (LBMP), which takes in to account the system marginal price, congestion component, and marginal loss component (PJM Interconnection LLC). The goal is to maximize profit, given the day-ahead prices and the battery system's parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this scenario, where future prices are known and the battery system is a price taker, the problem of designing an operational strategy can be solved by linear programming (Salles et al. 2017, Sioshansi et al. 2009, Wang and Zhang 2018). In brief summary, [linear programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_programming) is a well-known technique for either maximizing or minimizing some objective. In this case, we want to maximize profit. As long as the mathematical function describing the objective, known as the __objective function__, as well as the __constraints__ of the system, can all be described as linear combinations of the __decision variables__, which define the operational strategy, linear programming can be used to optimize the system."

    "Each day, a single optimization problem needs to be solved between 11am and 12pm, which will provide sufficient information to guide the battery's operation for the next 36 hours. To guide the battery's operation, we need to decide what the flow of energy will be for each discrete time step in the time horizon. Energy flows, also known as electrical power, can either be into or out of the battery. So we'll create two decision variables, $c_t$ and $d_t$, as the charging and discharging power flows, respectively (kW), at time $t$, which will be an hourly time step. The rates of charge or discharge are continuous variables and are bounded to be within the operating limits of the battery, for all time steps:\n",

    "We need to specify flow variables for each time step in the time horizon of optimization. PuLP provides a handy method `dicts` of the `LpVariable` class, which we can use to create charge and discharge flows for all time steps at once. We'll start defining a class that will hold all the information governing the operation of the battery. The input `time_horizon` is an integer specifiying the number of hours in the optimization horizon, assumed here to be at least 24, and the other inputs are as described above:"

    "# Conclusions\n",
    "\n",
    "We found that an energy arbitrage strategy for a grid-connected battery can be formulated using linear programming, assuming future prices are known over some time horizon. We showed that when operating under an illustrative set of system parameters and using real-world energy price data, such a system can generate an annual profit of \\\\$963.\n",
    "\n",
    "Further optimization for increased profit may be possible, if prices are able to be accurately predicted beyond the 36 hour optimization horizon used here. The NYISO price determination involves a load forecasting model, that depends on economic and weather factors. It may be possible to include such factors in a price forecasting model to estimate future day-ahead market prices that are not yet public. In another interesting direction, Wang and Zhang (2018) show that reinforcement learning using historical price data can lead to higher profits than maximizing instantaneous profit, suggesting other possible approaches to maximizing profit from energy arbitrage.\n",
    "\n",
    "I hope you found this post helpful for understanding how linear programming can be used to formulate an optimal arbitrage strategy if future prices are known."
